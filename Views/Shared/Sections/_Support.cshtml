                                    Treda is designed to work on more than 80% of the devices that you already own. As long as you use the device, it is good enough and Treda can run on the same device. Some of our clients, however, tend to purchase a separate computer for the business if they don't have one already.

                                    First, we never share your data with any one. All your data is only accessible by you or your employees.

                                    Secondly, all the business critical data is encrypted before it is stored. This means that even if you lost your devices, it would not be possible for someone to access your business data.
